### Source code contribution ways of working

- For creation of repositories please follow the following rules:
  -   respect a coherent naming with at least one of this pattern : `system-subsystem-description` or `system-techno-description`
  -   use provided templates as much as you can and report issues
  -   do not necessarily use movai in the name of your repository
  -   avoid using the prefix `movai_` as this is used to hold MOVAI ROS packages
- Always implement solutions on a branch
- Make sure your commit messages are self speaking
- Once you're done, create a pull request and ask at least one of the maintainers for review
  - Remember to title your pull request properly as it will be used for release notes
  - Make sure to include Jira ID (if created) in the PR title
  - Assign yourself as the owner for the PR to dev branches
  - Assign the maintainers as the owner for the PR to main branches
- NEVER EVER INSERT ANY CREDENTIAL, PASSWORD, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
  - Use secrets for both private and public repositories
